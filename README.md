# MIMiC

Melt inclusion modification corrections (MIMiC) - A program corrects melt inclusions for post-entrapment crystallization/melting (PEC/PEM) with optional corrections for Fe-Mg exchange with the host and vapor bubble growth.

MIMiC is presented in a paper that is accepted at American Mineralogist. Please cite as follows:
